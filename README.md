# bluetooth-listing
An android app to show nearby devices via Bluetooth.

The app uses Android Studio's Bluetooth objects to detect devices we connect with via bluetooth

We then list the devices we connect with in a ListView, and show things like their address and RSSI.
This is just to form the basis for my future apps to function with bluetooth.
